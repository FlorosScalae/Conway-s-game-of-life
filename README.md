A simple JavaScript implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), as in many versions there are controls for adding and removing cells in addition to changing the speed at which the simulation progresses. It also supports a drag and drop of a selection of small collections of cells that allows for fast and easy construction of more complex patterns.
